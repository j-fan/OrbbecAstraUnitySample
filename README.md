# Orbbec Unity Sample
## Prerequisites
- Windows machine
- Orbbec Astra
- Unity 2019+ (could work for others, but only tested with this)
- Visual Studio 2015+ (Orbbec SDKs seem fine in VS 2017)

## About
* Contains examples of depth and colour streams and body tracking (joints only)
* If you stand far back enough, spheres will appear representing joints
* Body tracking will only work until March 21 2020
* If you have your own licence, add it in AstraController.cs
